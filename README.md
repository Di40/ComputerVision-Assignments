# Vision and Cognitive Systems - Assignments

This repository contains practical exercises completed during the course Vision and Cognitive Systems at UniPd. The class teaches the concepts, methods, and technologies underlying computer vision and cognitive systems, including modern cognitive services such as APIs and cloud services that assist developers in building artificial intelligence applications.

## Assignments

1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Di40/ComputerVision-Assignments/blob/main/1%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Machine Learning, Linear Regression

2. [Image Filtering](https://github.com/Di40/ComputerVision-Assignments/blob/main/2%20-%20Image%20Filtering.ipynb): Image Filtering, Derivative Filters, Edge Detection

3. [SIFT](https://github.com/Di40/ComputerVision-Assignments/blob/main/3%20-%20SIFT.ipynb): Local Visual Features, SIFT Algorithm, Feature Matching 
   - Utilized OpenCV's SIFT algorithm for detecting keypoints and descriptors of an image.
   - For feature matching, used Brute-Force (BF) Matcher, K-NN matcher (in order to apply the ratio test as reported by [D. Lowe](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf)), and FLANN-based matcher.
